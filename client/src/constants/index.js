  Heavy or steady precipitation
  Recommended Actions:
  Keep cars and boats tuned up
  Use environmentally safe paints and cleaning products
  Conserve electricity-set A/C to highest comfortable level`,

  "Moderate": `
  AQI is 51 to 100. Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people. For example, people who are unusually sensitive to ozone may experience respiratory symptoms. Unusually sensitive people should consider reducing prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion.

  Keep cars and boats tuned up
  Use environmentally safe paints and cleaning products
  Conserve electricity-set A/C to highest comfortable level`,

  "Unhealthy for sensitive groups": `
  AQI is 101 to 150. Although general public is not likely to be affected at this AQI range, people with lung disease, older adults and children are at a greater risk from exposure to ozone, whereas persons with heart and lung disease, older adults and children are at greater risk from the presence of particles in the air. 
  Weather Conditions:
  Temperatures in the 80's and 90's
  Light winds
  Mostly sunny skies
  Slight chance of afternoon thunderstorms
