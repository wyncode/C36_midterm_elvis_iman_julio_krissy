  "Good": `
  Air quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk. 
  Weather Conditions:
  Cool summer temperatures
  Windy conditions
  Significant cloud cover
  Heavy or steady precipitation
  Recommended Actions:
  Keep cars and boats tuned up
  Use environmentally safe paints and cleaning products
  Conserve electricity-set A/C to highest comfortable level`,

  "Moderate": `
  Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people. For example, people who are unusually sensitive to ozone may experience respiratory symptoms. Unusually sensitive people should consider reducing prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion.
  Weather Conditions:
  Temperatures in the upper 70's to lower 80's
  Light to moderate winds
  Partly cloudy or mostly sunny skies
  Chance of rain or afternoon thunderstorms
  Recommended Actions:
  Keep cars and boats tuned up
  Use environmentally safe paints and cleaning products
  Conserve electricity-set A/C to highest comfortable level`,

  "Unhealthy for sensitive groups": `
  Although general public is not likely to be affected at this AQI range, people with lung disease, older adults and children are at a greater risk from exposure to ozone, whereas persons with heart and lung disease, older adults and children are at greater risk from the presence of particles in the air. 
  Weather Conditions:
  Temperatures in the 80's and 90's
  Light winds
  Mostly sunny skies
  Slight chance of afternoon thunderstorms
  Recommended Actions:
  Limit daytime driving
  Limit vehicle idling
  Refuel vehicles after dusk
  Don’t “top off” your gas tank
  Avoid congested periods
  Use water-based paints
  Use transit or car pool
  Bike or walk for short trips
  Use newest/best maintained car
  Combine trips and share rides
  Postpone using gasoline mowers
  Barbecue without starter fluid`,

  "Unhealthy": `
  Everyone may begin to experience some adverse health effects, and members of the sensitive groups may experience more serious effects.
  Weather Conditions:
  Hot, hazy, and humid
  Stagnant air
  Sunny skies
  Little chance of precipitation
  Recommended Actions:
  Limit daytime driving
  Limit vehicle idling
  Refuel vehicles after dusk
